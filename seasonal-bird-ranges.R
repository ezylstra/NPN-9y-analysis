# From https://science.ebird.org/en/status-and-trends/faq#seasons:

# Resident (i.e., non-migratory) species are identified by having TRUE in the 
# is_resident column of ebirdst_runs, and these species are assessed across the 
# whole year rather than seasonally. 

# The seasonal dates define the weeks that fall within each season. Breeding and 
# non-breeding season dates are defined for each species as the weeks during 
# those seasons when the speciesâ€™ population does not move. For this reason, 
# these seasons are also described as stationary periods. Migration periods are 
# defined as the periods of movement between the stationary non-breeding and 
# breeding seasons. Note that for many species these migratory periods include 
# not only movement from breeding grounds to non-breeding grounds, but also 
# post-breeding dispersal, molt migration, and other movements.

# A rating of 0 implies this season failed review and model results should not 
# be used at all for this period. Ratings of 1-3 correspond to a gradient of 
# more to less extrapolation and/or omission, and we often use a traffic light 
# analogy when referring to them:
# 1: low quality, extensive extrapolation and/or omission, but at least some 
# regions have estimates that are accurate; can be used with caution in certain 
# regions.
# 2: medium quality, some extrapolation and/or omission; use with caution.
# 3: high quality, very little or no extrapolation and/or omission.

# Using AMGO as an example
